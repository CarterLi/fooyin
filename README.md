## A customisable music player

fooyin is a music player built around customisation. It offers a growing list of widgets to manage and play your local music
collection. It's extendable through the use of plugins and many widgets make use of *FooScript* to offer an even deeper level of control.

Audio playback is supported by FFmpeg alongside multiple options for output including ALSA and PipeWire, with more to come.

A *layout editing mode* enables the entire user interface to be customised,
starting from a blank slate or a preset layout.
